# rseiler homepage

This is my personal homepage which is currently hosted on my [Raspberry Pi 2](http://www.raspberrypi.org/raspberry-pi-2-on-sale/).
The site is accessible under [http://rseiler.at](http://rseiler.at). Hopefully I will get a domain soon.

I am going to create a demo webapp based on this project and probably add some additional features. So that I can
demonstrate the full power of this setup and I will document it nicely. So that you can use this setup for yourself.
But I will need a few days (probably a few days more) to do that.
